# DiscordBot
A repo for a discord bot I'm working on

## How it works

The bot essentially parses deck codes like the following: `CEBAEAIEBALQWAQGA4EASGBCFAXDANZ2HYAACAICAYFA` into a format that is readable for humans. When parsed, it is displayed in the server in a message
that looks like the one below:

This is what the output of a parsed deck code looks like, it displays the regions, cards, and number of cards in the deck.<br>

This is how the bot's documention looks like, so that the users can always reference how to use it in their servers. <br>

</p>

Some example usage of the bot is to look up keywords in the game, for example:
